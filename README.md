# Project 1 - PacMan 

## Overview
The first of my projects on the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. After two weeks of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we were given a week to get creative and produce a grid based game of our choice.  

I went for PacMan game as the idea that it was possible to build such a classic game after two weeks really excited me! Originally I thought I would attempt to build this in the classic 80s style, but I ended up going for the theme of 'Safari ParcMan' as I liked the idea of having more creative freedom with the styling.

## The Brief
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (we will do this together at the end of the project)
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
