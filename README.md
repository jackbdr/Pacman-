# Project 1 - PacMan 

## Overview
The first of my projects on the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. After two weeks of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we were given a week to get creative and produce a grid based game of our choice.  

I went for PacMan game as the idea that it was possible to build such a classic game after two weeks really excited me! Originally I thought I would attempt to build this in the classic 80s style, but I ended up going for the theme of 'Safari ParcMan' as I liked the idea of having more creative freedom with the styling.
